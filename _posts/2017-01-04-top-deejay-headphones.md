#### First impressions.

Many years ago, I worked for my parents who own a video production company. Because it is a family business, you inevitably end up wearing many hats and being the czar of many different jobs. I mainly managed projects and worked as a video editor. On production, there were times that I was called on to work as an audio tech and was made to wear headphones on long production days. In those days, having a really good set of headphones that picked up every nuance of sound was essential to making sure the client got what they needed. Many years ago, I worked for my parents who own a video production company. Because it is a family business, you inevitably end up wearing many hats and being the czar of many different jobs. I mainly managed projects and worked as a video editor. On production, there were times that I was called on to work as an audio tech and was made to wear headphones on long production days. In those days, having a really good set of headphones that picked up every nuance of sound was essential to making sure the client got what they needed.

Naturally, my first impression of these headphones is based off of the look of them. They have a classic over-the-ear style that is highlighted by **a blue LED light** that indicates the power for the noise canceling. The padding on the ear pieces seems adequate for extended usage periods.

They are wired headphones, but the 3.5mm stereo mini-plug cable is detachable. Something else I noticed right of the bat was the very nice carrying case that comes with them. It has a hard plastic exterior with a soft cloth interior that helps to protect the surface of the headphones from scratches. I never truly appreciated cases for headphones until I started carrying them from place-to-place. Now I can’t imagine not having a case.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]\[vc\_row row\_height\_percent=&#8221;50&#8243; override\_padding=&#8221;yes&#8221; h\_padding=&#8221;2&#8243; top\_padding=&#8221;0&#8243; bottom\_padding=&#8221;0&#8243; back\_color=&#8221;color-wayh&#8221; back\_image=&#8221;2286&#8243; back\_position=&#8221;center top&#8221; parallax=&#8221;yes&#8221; overlay\_color=&#8221;color-wayh&#8221; overlay\_alpha=&#8221;60&#8243; gutter\_size=&#8221;3&#8243; shift\_y=&#8221;0&#8243; row\_height\_use\_pixel=&#8221;&#8221;\]\[vc\_column column\_width\_percent=&#8221;100&#8243; position\_vertical=&#8221;middle&#8221; align\_horizontal=&#8221;align\_center&#8221; override\_padding=&#8221;yes&#8221; column\_padding=&#8221;2&#8243; style=&#8221;dark&#8221; overlay\_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter\_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium\_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift\_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift\_y=&#8221;0&#8243; zoom\_width=&#8221;0&#8243; zoom\_height=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1/1&#8243;\]\[vc\_custom\_heading heading\_semantic=&#8221;h6&#8243; text\_size=&#8221;h1&#8243; text\_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text\_font=&#8221;font-175345&#8243; text\_weight=&#8221;400&#8243; sub\_lead=&#8221;yes&#8221; sub\_reduced=&#8221;yes&#8221; text\_uppercase=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;John Williams&#8221;\]It’s safe to say that because of my unique professional experiences, I’ve tested out a lot of headphones.\[/vc\_custom\_heading\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]\[vc\_row unlock\_row=&#8221;&#8221; row\_height\_percent=&#8221;0&#8243; override\_padding=&#8221;yes&#8221; h\_padding=&#8221;2&#8243; top\_padding=&#8221;3&#8243; bottom\_padding=&#8221;2&#8243; overlay\_alpha=&#8221;100&#8243; gutter\_size=&#8221;3&#8243; shift\_y=&#8221;0&#8243; row\_height\_use\_pixel=&#8221;&#8221;\]\[vc\_column column\_width\_use\_pixel=&#8221;yes&#8221; overlay\_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter\_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium\_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift\_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift\_y=&#8221;0&#8243; zoom\_width=&#8221;0&#8243; zoom\_height=&#8221;0&#8243; column\_width\_pixel=&#8221;800&#8243;\]\[vc\_column_text\]

#### A perfect fit.

Once I gave the headphones a thorough once-over exam, I tried them on. As I mentioned, they have a classic _over-the-ear style_ and just looking at them, the padding on the ear pieces seem adequate and the peak of the headband seemed to be a bit lacking, but you don’t really know comfort unless you try on the product. So, I slipped the headphones on and found them to be exquisitely comfortable. In order to test how voices sounded, and the overall art of sound mixing, I pulled up Netflix on my iPad Air 2 and watched a few minutes of a movie to hear all the nuances of the film. None of them were lost. In fact, I ended up hearing sounds that I hadn’t heard before. Echoes…birds chirping…wind blowing through trees…breathing of the characters…it was very impressive what the headphones ended up bringing out for me.

#### Quality.

Now that I had the headphones on my head, I was finally ready to plug and play some music. I plugged the provided cable into the jack on the headphones and then the one on my iPhone 6. Then I called up Pandora. I tend to have a very eclectic music purview and have many stations set up for different moods. From **John Williams** to **Fallout Boy**, the sound quality of these headphones was remarkable. There is an amazing depth of sound and incredible highs and lows that make listening to music a truly breathtaking experience.
