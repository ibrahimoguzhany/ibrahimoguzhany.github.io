excerpt: 'Last year I wrote about why booking too far in advance can be dangerous for your business, and this concept of margin so eloquently captures what I had recognized had been my problem: I was so booked up with clients that I wasn’t leaving any margin for error, growth, planning, or reflection.'

It runs about $1300. It’s easily the best camera I’ve ever owned. I take care of it as best as I can, but I don’t let taking care of it impact the photography. Let me elaborate on that a bit better. You’ll get better at each section of what we talked about slowly. And while you do, you’ll be amazed at how much easier it all is and how the habit forms. The best way to get better at photography is start by taking your camera everywhere. If you leave your house, your camera leaves with you. The only exception is if you’re planning for a weekend bender — then probably leave it at home. Other than that, always have it slung over your shoulder. It would probably help to get an extra battery to carry in your pocket. I’ve got three batteries. One in my camera, one in my pocket, one in the charger.

When it dies, swap them all.

For me, the most important part of improving at photography has been sharing it. Sign up for an Exposure account, or post regularly to Tumblr, or both. Tell people you’re trying to get better at photography. Talk about it. When you talk about it, other people get excited about it. They’ll come on photo walks with you. They’ll pose for portraits. They’ll buy your prints, zines, whatever.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]\[vc\_row unlock\_row\_content=&#8221;yes&#8221; row\_height\_percent=&#8221;50&#8243; override\_padding=&#8221;yes&#8221; h\_padding=&#8221;0&#8243; top\_padding=&#8221;0&#8243; bottom\_padding=&#8221;0&#8243; back\_color=&#8221;color-lxmt&#8221; overlay\_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; equal\_height=&#8221;yes&#8221; gutter\_size=&#8221;0&#8243; shift\_y=&#8221;0&#8243; row\_height\_use\_pixel=&#8221;&#8221;\]\[vc\_column column\_width\_percent=&#8221;70&#8243; position\_vertical=&#8221;middle&#8221; override\_padding=&#8221;yes&#8221; column\_padding=&#8221;5&#8243; overlay\_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter\_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium\_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift\_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift\_y=&#8221;0&#8243; zoom\_width=&#8221;0&#8243; zoom\_height=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1/2&#8243;\]\[vc\_custom\_heading text\_size=&#8221;h1&#8243; text\_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text\_font=&#8221;font-202503&#8243; sub\_lead=&#8221;yes&#8221; sub\_reduced=&#8221;yes&#8221; text\_uppercase=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;— Rabindranath Tagore&#8221;\]Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky.\[/vc\_custom\_heading\]\[/vc\_column\]\[vc\_column column\_width\_percent=&#8221;100&#8243; override\_padding=&#8221;yes&#8221; column\_padding=&#8221;0&#8243; back\_color=&#8221;color-wayh&#8221; back\_image=&#8221;11419&#8243; back\_position=&#8221;center top&#8221; parallax=&#8221;yes&#8221; overlay\_alpha=&#8221;0&#8243; gutter\_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium\_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift\_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift\_y=&#8221;0&#8243; zoom\_width=&#8221;0&#8243; zoom\_height=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1/2&#8243;\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]\[vc\_row unlock\_row=&#8221;&#8221; row\_height\_percent=&#8221;0&#8243; override\_padding=&#8221;yes&#8221; h\_padding=&#8221;2&#8243; top\_padding=&#8221;5&#8243; bottom\_padding=&#8221;5&#8243; overlay\_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter\_size=&#8221;3&#8243; shift\_y=&#8221;0&#8243; row\_height\_use\_pixel=&#8221;&#8221;\]\[vc\_column column\_width\_use\_pixel=&#8221;yes&#8221; font\_family=&#8221;font-134980&#8243; overlay\_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter\_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium\_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift\_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift\_y=&#8221;0&#8243; zoom\_width=&#8221;0&#8243; zoom\_height=&#8221;0&#8243; column\_width\_pixel=&#8221;800&#8243;\]\[vc\_custom\_heading text\_size=&#8221;h1&#8243; text\_font=&#8221;font-202503&#8243; text\_uppercase=&#8221;&#8221;\]Breathe the world.\[/vc\_custom\_heading\]\[vc\_column\_text text\_lead=&#8221;yes&#8221;\]I’ve got a Fujifilm X100s.
