  Once I gave the headphones a thorough once-over exam, I tried them on. As I mentioned, they have a classic over-the-ear style and just looking at them, the padding on the ear pieces seem adequate and the peak of the headband seemed to be a bit lacking, but you donâ€™t really know comfort unless you try on the product. So, I slipped the headphones on and found them to be exquisitely comfortable. Once I gave the headphones a thorough once-over exam, I tried them on.

  If no one hates you, no one is paying attention. If attention is what you want for vanity, confidence, or, hellâ€Šâ€”â€Što make a decent livingâ€Šâ€”â€Šthen know that itâ€™s not instantaneous. Every single person that youâ€™re currently paying attention to, at some point in their lives, was in your exact position.

  Just like every other human on the planet, I have epically awesome days and days when life just turne against me. And while I canâ€™t stand most self-help (see: tired quotes over stock photography on Instagram), sometimes I need a little pick-me-up. And most of the time, in order to get out of a slump (because my brain leans more into math/science than anything else), I need to drop a logic bomb on my ass.

  Yes, this is a long article. But hereâ€™s the thingâ€Šâ€”â€Šif youâ€™re reading this in your inbox and are already like, â€œfuck this!â€ delete it. No hard feelings. If youâ€™re reading this in a browser on a website, and you see how tiny the scroll-bar is because of how far you still have to scroll to get to the bottom, close this tab and go back to 140-character tidbits of advice.Â Still with me? Phew. Just had to weed out all the folks from points: #1, #4 and #8. Welcome friends, onward we go.

Every single person that youâ€™re currently paying attention to, at some point in their lives, was in your exact position. They kept at it and worked enough so that others started listening.Â Also know that if no one is watching, you can experience true freedom. Dance in your underwear. Write entirely for yourself. Like thereâ€™s a going-out-of-business sale. Find yourselfâ€Šâ€”â€Šnot in some coming-of-age hippie way involving pasta and ashramsâ€” but in a way that helps you draw your own line in the sand for what matters and what doesnâ€™t. Do what you want to do, just because you want to do that thing. This will build confidence that will come in handy later.
